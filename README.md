## Assignment :page_facing_up:

---

You need to make a form for a webshop, and add validation to the form. The customer can order various sandwiches, and then both the restaurant owner and the customer receive an e-mail with the details of the order.

You will add a counter at the bottom of the page that shows the total amount of money that has been spent on this page for this user. This counter should keep going up even when the user closes his browser.

You can start modifying index.php and form-view.php, they already contain some code to help you on your way.
